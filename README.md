# A table of contents for Xaringan

The lack of a table of contents in Xaringan has actually been an open 
[issue](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/217) since 2019.
Other html presentation formats in R Markdown, such
as **revealjs::revealjs_presentation**  and **slidy_presentation** 
do provide a table of contents, which allows for a faster navigation of the slides.

As Yihui explained in the issue page above, an implementation of a table of contents
for Xaringan is actually a simple project requiring JavaScript. So, I've implemented
just that, respecting the properties explained by Yihui in this 
[comment](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/217#issuecomment-508784341) of his.
